            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a low-poly terrain generator using multiple layers of perlin noise textures and lit by a Blinn-Phong lighting model from scratch. This terrain generator has built in dynamic normal calculation, terrain painting through a heightmap, and a simple noise-based water plane all with controllable features at runtime.</p>

            <p>This project was created as my final for my Graphics 1 course in the Fall Semester of my Sophomore year. It has had lasting effects on my choices in game development as this was the project that got me hooked in the graphics specialization. I was very happy with the outcome of this project and it provided me with a good glimpse into graphics programming as a whole.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><learned-titles>Look at Multiple Approaches to the Same Problem:</learned-titles> A complex problem, especially in game development, usually has more than one answer. In Graphics specifically, there are a lot of different formulas or techniques to achieve the same result. Finding those techniques and implementing each of them allows you to find what works best for your projects and what is also performant.</li>
                <li><learned-titles>Subject Matter Experts are your Best Friends:</learned-titles> Talking to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) really can help expand your perception of a problem. They can provide their own feedback as well as provide useful insight on how to utilize your resources more effectively and get the results that you want. In this case, I used my Graphics Professor (shoutout Eric Winebrenner), but even if this wasnâ€™t a course, even going on websites like LinkedIn, or looking at Game Development advice spreadsheets allows you to connect with professionals that (hopefully) are willing to help.</li>
                <li><learned-titles>Establish a Workflow:</learned-titles> Find what works for you as an individual and how you like to work. For me, I get my best work done in hour long increments late at night in the comfort of my own room and setup. Establishing a working routine as well as what organizational tools work the best and how to tailor them to your workflow is extremely important and has allowed me to be more productive than when I was sporadically doing work.</li>
