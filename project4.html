            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This project is a fully modular weapon customization system built using Unity, C#, and built-in systems such as Unity’s Scriptable Objects. Weapons have 3 different parts; Body, Grip, and Barrel. Each of these parts hold various pieces of controllable data effect the weapon in various ways, whether it be fire rate, bullet spread, or any of the 12 different values that are changeable based off of which parts you have equipped.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This was a personal project that I embarked on throughout the summer of 2023 to establish an understanding of the concept of modularity. I decided after a couple test runs to work in Unity and C# as my foundational understanding of syntax and design principles were already there. I also personally really enjoy making systems like these as they challenge my critical thinking skills.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><learned-titles>Utilize Your Engine:</learned-titles> In this case, this project was built using the Unity game engine. Every engine, whether it be Unity, Unreal, Godot, or anything else has built in features that should be taken advantage of for the sake of easy implementation for your specific project. In this case, working with Unity’s Scriptable Objects system thoroughly allows me to have this structure in the back of my mind as I continue building systems in the future.</li>
                <li><learned-titles>Expand Your Skill Set:</learned-titles> I am very much a graphics person, but it is always good to expand the amount of knowledge you have for other disciplines. Building systems, doing level design, learning Blender, anything that can allow you to diversify your skills can really help, not only your own individual production, but also help give for a better product in a team setting as well.</li>
