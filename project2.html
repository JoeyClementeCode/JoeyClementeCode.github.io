            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Boundless Blade is a fast paced, top down roguelite experience that utilizes a digital drawing tablet as an extraneous controller for combat. You take on the role of a Ronin that uses a supernatural blade that has the power to pass through multiple enemies at the same time and fight off hordes of enemies coming for your head. As the waves keep coming in, so do you, with upgrades to your physical abilities and to the sword itself. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Boundless Blade was made as the Final of 3 Projects for our Game Studio 1 production course. The prompt was something unique; create a game using an alternate controller. With that prompt in mind, my team and I sat down and brainstormed different alternatives to the traditional player inputs (keyboard/mouse and controller) so we decided to still ground our roots in reality and chose a drawing tablet as our main input. This project lasted us 6 weeks and we took full advantage of the agile workflow and scrum to give us a product we can be proud of.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><learned-titles>Clear Documentation Give you a Leg Up:</learned-titles> An important concept that was taught to us was how documentation across all disciplines can not only make the entire game creation process easier to understand but also allow you to just make a better product as a whole. As a programmer, I wasn’t in charge of my documentation, my one piece being a Technical Plan (linked below), which was updated every week and provided a good overview of pipelines, coding standards, and goals. This documentation, as well as other pieces such as Art and Design documentation really paves a pretty straightforward path to success in the product you are making. </li>
                <li><learned-titles>Iteration, Iteration, Iteration:</learned-titles> Whether it be documentation, systems, graphics, or literally anything. Don’t stop after the initial attempt. Everything can be improved upon and nothing is perfect. Whether you think it is or not, it’s not your decision, it’s the users playing your game that decide. Having what you might think are “flawless” systems by a design and programming expectation players might not even like. A good goal that I have found that works better (in a smaller team environment) is to have everything work cohesively together and iterate accordingly based off of that notion than every asset, system, graphic being individualized.</li>
                <li><learned-titles>Direct Communication with your Team is Extremely Important:</learned-titles> Being personable and actually talking to your team is vital to a product’s success. Being an extroverted person, I myself have found this relatively easy, but the impact and importance of drawing that talkative nature from your more quiet teammates is unmatched. When everyone is talking and giving constructive feedback, things get done with a lot more efficiency, and most importantly with a greater degree of passion and fun.</li>
