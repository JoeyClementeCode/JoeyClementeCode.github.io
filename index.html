                            <p>I am currently a Junior, studying Game Programming at Champlain College with ranging experience in both the indie and collegiate levels.</p>
                            <p>I am currently pursuing my passion of create gameplay experiences. I have been able to accomplish this on my own through game jams and other solo projects, but also in team projects ranging from 3-8 members across all different disciplines.

                                <p>Boundless Blade is a 2D top down endless horde game that was made for our Sophomore Studio 1 class. It was made by a 6 person team where I was the sole programmer. I was in charge, obviously as the only programmer, of implementation of practically everything. It gave me a good chance to really dig deep and gain new knowledge on subject matter that I had not really touched on before.</p>
                                <p>Working with this team I was really able to understand all aspects of the game development pipeline while implementing good project management practices through the use of Agile. Managing my own sections of the taskboard, making and refining my own documentation, and being able to collaborate respectfully with all of the other disciplines really gave me a path to grow.</p>
                                <p>The highlight of this project was the upgrade and rarity systems that were used to give a depth to user progression. It included 4 rarity systems as well as a active and passive upgrades that allowed the player to grow stronger over time. With this system, I was really able to understand how to tailor to designers needs and really bring a new foundational collaborative aspect to system design and implementation.</p>
